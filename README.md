Atom is awesome, but this repo isn't.

This is a personal repo where I tried to solve some virtualbox/chromium bug and
another bug that apparently only happens when I build Atom with newer Electron
versions.

I created a issue on the main repo, which you can see here: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7974
